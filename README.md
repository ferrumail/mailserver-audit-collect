# mailserver-audit-collect
create a tar archive with data required to fill a audit report for Linux mailserver

I will write more than one script, for example sendmail will have own one.

 a. These scripts don't change anything on the server
 b. These scripts read some system configuration files
 c. These scripts can query running process about their current config
 d. These scripts will write an archive with data collected
